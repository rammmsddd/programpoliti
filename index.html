        LineLib — Software Commands Reference · Last updated: February 18, 2026
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        LineLib ("we", "our", or "the app") is a software commands reference
        application. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy
        Policy explains how we handle information when you use our application.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong> LineLib does not
        require an account, login, or any personal information to function.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Storage</h2>
      <p>
        All data created within the app (such as saved commands, collections,
        and preferences) is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>.
        This data is never transmitted to any server or third party.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Saved commands and collections — stored on device</li>
        <li>App preferences and settings — stored on device</li>
        <li>Search history — not stored</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>AI Assistant Feature</h2>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>
          LineLib includes an optional AI Assistant feature that helps users
          with software-related questions. This feature requires an internet
          connection.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        When you use the AI Assistant:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your questions are sent to <strong>OpenRouter</strong> (a third-party AI API service) for processing.</li>
        <li>Only the text of your question is transmitted — <strong>no personal data, device information, or usage analytics</strong> are included.</li>
        <li>The AI is restricted to answering questions about 3D modeling and 2D design software only.</li>
        <li>Questions and responses are <strong>not stored on any server</strong>. They exist only in memory during your app session.</li>
        <li>OpenRouter's privacy policy can be found at: <a href="https://openrouter.ai/privacy" target="_blank">openrouter.ai/privacy</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The AI Assistant has a daily usage limit and does not process questions
        unrelated to software commands and shortcuts.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        LineLib uses the following third-party service:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenRouter API</strong> — Used exclusively for the AI Assistant feature. No personal data is shared. Only the text of user questions about software commands is transmitted.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        LineLib does not integrate with any analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
      </p>

      <h2>Internet Access</h2>
      <p>
        LineLib's core functionality (browsing commands and shortcuts) works
        <strong>entirely offline</strong>. Internet access is only required for
        the optional AI Assistant feature.
      </p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        LineLib does not collect any personal information from anyone, including
        children under the age of 13. The app is safe for users of all ages.
      </p>

        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
        reflected on this page with an updated revision date.
