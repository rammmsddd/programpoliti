        By downloading, installing, or using LineLib ("the App"), you agree to
        be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms,

      <h2>Use of the App</h2>
      <p>
        LineLib provides a command reference tool for software shortcuts and
        commands. The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind,
        either express or implied.

      </p>

      <h2>Advertising</h2>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>
          The App displays advertisements through
          <strong>Google AdMob</strong>, including interstitial and rewarded ads.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>

          There is a daily usage limit on AI messages.
